"This is called eServices Automated Messaging Rules in the UI. These are used to track the automated generation and sending of appointment reminders and confirmations. Users are allowed to define up to two reminders and one confirmation (per clinic). These can be sent out any number of Days, Hours, and/or Minutes before a scheduled appointment. PRACTICE - Appointment Reminder Rules will be saved and edited with clinicNum=0. This denotes the ""Defaults"" when using clinics, but for a practice the defaults become the practice rules.CLINICS - When using clinics, each clinic has a bool ""IsConfirmEnabled"" that determines if a particular clinic has automated reminders/confirmations enabled. If not, no reminders will be sent out for the clinic. If enabled, and no rules are defined for the clinic, then the clinic will attempt to use the defaults that have been defined with clinicNum==0. If a clinic is enabled and has at least one AppointmentReminderRule defined, then NO defaults will be used for that clinic.REMINDERS - reminders are sent out using the ApptComm system implemented by DerekG. These used to be stored as preferences for the practice only. Now users are allowed to define them on a per-clinic basis. Reminders should be considered one way communications and should not be desingned with a customer response in mind.CONFIRMATIONS - confirmations are sent using the new automated-confirmation system implemented by RyanM (proper) and SamO (web backend). Confirmations are intended to allow end patients to respond to OpenDental via text or email and automatically confirm, or set to a desired status, the appointments on the schedule.",,,

Example: Vis=Do Not Call, Db=DoNotCall. For radiobuttons, the number of items in the lists determines the number of radiobuttons to show to the patient. These editable lists also allow excluding some db options from being visible to patient. Example: Ins Relationship has 9 options, but only 4 of them are really used in dentistry. Just leave the other 5 off and force them to pick one of the 4. But it is also not required for them to pick one. Example: For Marital Status, you might only show Married and Child, excluding Divorced and Single from the pick list. The unselected state then represents no change, so an existing patient could leave both radio buttons unchecked and their status would remain Divorced or Single. However, we currently lack a feature to let them uncheck a radiobutton that is already checked. This is a rare edge case that nearly nobody will care about. You can also have a row with no db value. For example, a visible value of Separated might have no corresponding db value entered. In that case, an import would not cause any change to the existing db value. These lists also allow two radioButtons to represent one db item. Example: Gender Other in db can be expanded to show patient both Nonbinary and Other. When patient picks either of these, it goes into the db as Other. The lists also allow any or all items to be empty with no label. Example: Y/N radiobuttons for a series of allergies. Y/N label at top, but none of the radiobuttons need labels. When translation is added later, it will translate this list, not the PickListDb.

The discussion here is for fixed widths. See IsWidthPercentage for discussion of percentage widths. If fields are stacked horizontally, then they will wrap when they hit screen width. So horizontally stacked fields may end up vertically stacked on a small screen. But if a single field is still set to be wider than the current screen, it will shrink to fit the screen. This width uses WPF DIPs which are 1/96"". Android phones define DIPs differently; they use 1/160"" per DIP. But if you are using a language like Flutter, they are handling that conversion for you in the background. Regardless, we will be ignoring DIPs and scaling based solely on font size. The reason for this is to make fonts and boxes all look proportionally the same on both OD proper and in eClipboard. So assuming you use 14 flutter logical pixels for 100% font vs 11.5 in WPF, the conversion would look like this: Width/11.5*14. Notice that we are only converting based on font size. This makes our converted width a near perfect fit for the same text as the original. Width is only available on the field types that are h-stackable."

Typical recommended font size on Android seems to be about 16, which translates to 9.6 MS DIPs or 7.2 old Windows font. In other words, recommended phone fonts are physically slightly smaller than desktop fonts. EForms uses font sizes based on 100% being a standard normal size. 100% equates to 11.5 on desktop, probably about 16 on Android phones, and whatever our engineers come up with for tablets.

There is no allowed mixing of fixed and percentage on the same row. Wrap won't happen until all columns have hit their MinWidth. If someone specifies percentages that add up to more than 100, that's ok. We will proportionally adapt. So in addition to expected percentages like 30-30-40, the user would get the same behavior by using 150-150-200. Let's use the example of 150-150-200 and assume MinWidths were 110-100-100. If available width was 400, then the widths would be 120-120-160. If available width was 330, then the widths would be 110-94-126, or (minWidth)-3/7-4/7. Below 310, they would start wrapping. If percentages add up to less than 100, then they might stop short of 100%. For example, 25-25-25 would come up short. They would continue to occupy 75% of available space until the space got so small that they started to hit their MinWidths. Let's assume MinWidths in that example were 50-100-100. If available width was 600, then the widths would be 150-150-150 (still 75%). If available width was 300, then the widths would be 75-100-100 (only 92%). Below 250, they would start wrapping."

So if a font size of 13.8 is present in the FlowDocument, that does not mean to use 13.8; it instead means to use 120%.

The OD signature format looks like this: 45,68;48,70;49,72;0,0;55,88;etc. Tenths are allowed, so it's common to see decimals. It's simply a sequence of points, separated by semicolons. 0,0 represents pen up. Then, a hash is created from the Note, concatenated directly with the userNum. For example, ""This is a note3"" gets turned into a hash of 2849283940385391 (16 bytes). The hash is used to encrypt the signature data string using symmetric encryption. Therefore, the actual signature cannot be retrieved from the database by ordinary means. Also, the signature info cannot even be retrieved by Open Dental at all unless it supplies the same hash as before, proving that the data has not changed since signed. If OD supplies the correct hash, then it will be able to extract the sequence of vectors which it will then use to display the signature. The OD sigs are not compressed, and the Topaz sigs are. But there is very little difference in their sizes. It would be very rare for a signature to be larger than 1000 bytes."

recall,,,
"A patient can only have one recall object per type. The recall table stores a few dates that must be kept synchronized with other information in the database. This is difficult. Anytime one of the following items changes, things need to be synchronized: procedurecode.SetRecall, any procedurelog change for a patient (procs added, deleted, completed, status changed, date changed, etc), patient status changed. There are expected to be a few bugs in the synchronization logic, so anytime a patient's recall is opened, it will also update. During synchronization, the program will frequently alter DateDueCalc, DateDue, and DatePrevious based on trigger procs. The system will also add and delete recalls as necessary. But it will not delete a recall unless all values are default and there is no useful information. When a user tries to delete a recall, they will only be successful if the trigger conditions do not apply. Otherwise, they will have to disable the recall instead.",,,
