## üß± Schema Design (Inspired by Open Dental)

### `patient`
- `id`: UUID
- `first_name`, `last_name`, `middle_initial`
- `dob`, `gender`, `phone`, `email`, `address`
- `guarantor_id` (FK)
- `clinic_id` (FK)
- `preferred_language`

### `appointment`
- `id`: UUID
- `patient_id` (FK)
- `datetime_start`, `datetime_end`
- `provider_id`, `status`, `confirmed`, `notes`
- `operatory`, `pattern`

### `procedure_log`
- `id`: UUID
- `patient_id` (FK)
- `status`, `procedure_code`, `tooth_number`, `surface`
- `note`, `date`, `amount`

### `insurance_plan`
- `id`: UUID
