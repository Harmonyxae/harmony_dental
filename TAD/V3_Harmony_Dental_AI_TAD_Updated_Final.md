## üî≠ Vision

Harmony Dental AI is a cloud-native, AI-first dental operating system designed to reduce clinic dependence on human staff by deploying intelligent, continuously learning agents across every workflow ‚Äî from reception to insurance, from diagnosis to cosmetic upsells.

---

## üß© Core System Modules (AI Agent-Driven)

### 1. AI Receptionist Agent
- 24/7 voice and **SMS/MMS** (not WhatsApp)
- Manages booking, rescheduling, confirmations
- Answers questions, logs all interactions
- **Prompt editable from UI**, clinic can customize agent tone and script

### 2. AI Scheduler Agent
- Fills cancellations automatically
- Predicts no-shows using historic + behavioral patterns
- Adjusts provider utilization dynamically

### 3. Voice Charting & Diagnosis Agent
- Doctor speaks ‚Üí SOAP note + procedure codes
- Recommends CDT codes
- Learns provider preferences over time

### 4. AI Radiograph Agent
- Analyzes intraoral/X-ray images
- Identifies decay, infection, bone loss
- Auto-highlights affected areas on odontogram

### 5. Billing & Insurance Agent
- Suggests ADA CDT codes
- Submits claims
- Predicts denials
- Escalates to human when confidence is low

### 6. AI Nurturing Agent
- Runs reactivation campaigns
- Uses SMS, email, and voice outreach
- Responds to engagement and follows up automatically

### 7. SmileBot (Cosmetic Agent)
- Creates smile simulations
- Recommends whitening/veneers
- Follows up to book cosmetic consults

### 8. Intelligence Agent (Virtual Office Manager)
- Tracks KPI metrics
- Detects hygiene underutilization
- Flags lost revenue, production gaps
