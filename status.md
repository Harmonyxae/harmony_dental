❓ QUESTIONS FOR YOU
Before proceeding, I need clarity on:

Which agent should we complete first?

Voice Charting (85% done) for quick win?
Receptionist (70% done) for business impact?
Do you have specific priorities?

Clinical workflow (Voice Charting)?
Patient experience (Receptionist)?
Revenue optimization (Billing)?
What's your timeline preference?

Complete one agent fully before moving to next?
Build core features across multiple agents?
Do you have access to:

Real dental practice data for testing?
CDT code database or should we purchase/scrape it?
Insurance API credentials for claims processing?
Integration priorities:

Should agents work independently first?
Or build cross-agent communication from start?
🚀 MY RECOMMENDATION
Complete Voice Charting Agent first because:

✅ 85% already done (quick win)
✅ High clinical value (doctors will love it)
✅ Showcase-worthy (impressive demo)
✅ Foundation for other agents (prompt service integration)
Then move to Receptionist Agent for maximum business impact.

What's your preference? Let me know which agent you want to focus on and I'll build it out completely!
