Perfect! Now that we have our comprehensive project documentation and schema mapping in place, let's start implementing. Based on our roadmap and MVP priorities, here's exactly what we're going to do next:

ðŸŽ¯ IMPLEMENTATION PHASE 1: MVP FOUNDATION
Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2): Core Infrastructure
Goal: Set up the foundational architecture for AI-first operations

Week 1 Tasks:

Project Setup & Environment

Initialize Node.js backend with TypeScript
Set up PostgreSQL database with multi-tenant architecture
Configure Docker containers for development
Set up basic CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
Database Foundation

Implement core tables: patients, appointments, procedures
Add AI enhancement fields and indexes
Create tenant provisioning system
Build basic CRUD operations with tenant isolation
Week 2 Tasks: 3. API Architecture

Build RESTful API with Express.js
Implement JWT authentication with tenant validation
Create GraphQL layer for complex queries
Set up Redis for caching and session management
Open Dental Migration Scripts
Build Python scripts to extract Open Dental data
Create data transformation and mapping logic
Implement tenant-specific data import
Test with sample Open Dental database
Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4): Receptionist Agent MVP
Goal: Launch first AI agent with voice and text capabilities

Week 3 Tasks:

AI Infrastructure Setup

Integrate OpenAI API for conversation logic
Set up Twilio for voice calls and SMS
Configure WhatsApp Business API
Build basic agent interaction logging
Receptionist Agent Core Logic

Implement appointment booking workflow
Create FAQ response system
Build patient lookup and verification
Add basic conversation memory
Week 4 Tasks: 3. Voice & Communication Channels

Integrate Whisper for speech-to-text
Set up ElevenLabs for natural voice synthesis
Build multi-channel message routing
Create conversation transcript logging
Basic Web Interface
Build React frontend for practice dashboard
Create agent monitoring interface
Add basic appointment management UI
Implement real-time interaction logs

ðŸ¤” DECISION POINT
Which component should we start building first?

Option A: Database-First Approach (Recommended)

Build schema, models, and API foundation
Then add AI agents on top of solid data layer
Option B: AI-Agent-First Approach

Start with Receptionist Agent prototype
Build database as needed for agent functionality
My Recommendation: Database-first approach because:

Provides stable foundation for all agents
Enables proper tenant isolation from day 1
Allows parallel AI agent development once foundation is ready
Matches our schema mapping document
What's your preference? Should we start with:

Setting up the database and API foundation?
Or jump straight into building the Receptionist Agent prototype?
Once you confirm the approach, I'll start providing the actual implementation code and step-by-step setup instructions.
