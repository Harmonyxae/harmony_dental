🎯 CURRENT STATUS UPDATE
AGENT COMPLETION STATUS:
✅ Receptionist Agent: 95% Complete (ElevenLabs integrated)

## BILLING Agent
💰 BILLING AGENT COMPLETION - FILE ANALYSIS NEEDED
Perfect! Let's complete Agent #3 (Billing Agent). Based on our previous discussions, the Billing Agent currently sits at 50% complete with basic CDT codes and insurance framework.

📋 FILES I NEED TO REVIEW
To properly complete the Billing Agent with ElevenLabs integration and advanced features, please share these files:

🔍 CORE BILLING FILES (Must See)
Any existing billing service - billingAgent.ts or similar (if exists)
CDT Code management - How are codes currently stored/managed?
Insurance handling - Current insurance verification/claims logic
Billing routes - Any existing billing API endpoints
📊 DATABASE MODELS (Need to Check)
Procedures model details - From your schema.prisma (the CDT code structure)
Insurance models - How insurance data is stored
Claims/billing models - Current billing data structure
🎯 INTEGRATION FILES (For Enhancement)
Any existing billing UI components
Patient billing history components
Current API integration patterns
❓ SPECIFIC QUESTIONS
Based on your file structure, I don't see obvious billing files, so let me ask:

Do you have a billingAgent.ts file or is this completely new?

How are CDT codes currently stored?

In the database?
External API?
Static file?
Do you have insurance verification APIs set up already?

What billing features are working currently from the 50% complete status?

🚀 PROPOSED BILLING AGENT ARCHITECTURE
Based on our ElevenLabs pattern, the Billing Agent will handle:

📞 Voice Interactions
Insurance verification calls
Payment collection calls
Billing inquiry responses
Claims status updates
🧠 AI Features
Automatic CDT code suggestions
Insurance claim optimization
Payment plan recommendations
Billing anomaly detection
🔗 ElevenLabs Integration
Server tools for insurance verification
Real-time payment processing
Billing conversation flows
Payment reminder automation
📁 WHICH FILES FIRST?
Please share:

Your current Procedures model from schema.prisma
Any existing billing-related files in services or routes
How you're currently handling CDT codes
Then I can build the complete Billing Agent with ElevenLabs integration that handles insurance verification, payment collection, and automated billing workflows!

What billing functionality do you currently have working?
